====================================
Sphinx theme for documentation sites
====================================

Sphinx is commonly used for documentation sites, but there is a lack of simple
and elegant themes. This small theme tries to fix that through a minimalist
approach, offering a great way to build a small documentation without great
expectations that distract from the site's actual use: documenting a project.
